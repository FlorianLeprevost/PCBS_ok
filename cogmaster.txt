Curriculum
The goal of the Cogmaster is to train high-level scientists in at least one discipline of cognitive science, with broad knowledge and a solid methodological training covering all of the cognitive sciences. 


Each Cogmaster student builds, together with his/her tutor, a personalised curriculum organised around one major and one or several optional minors. Majors typically correspond to the main areas of cognitive science, and may be chosen according to each students’ project and skills.

Requirements for each semester and each major are found here.

Majors are: 

Philosophy ;
Social science;
Linguistics ;
Psychology ;
Neuroscience ;
Modelling ;
In addition, there is a special major that may be validated in M2 only : Cognitive engineering.
