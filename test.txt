the goal of the cogmaster is to train high-level scientists in at least one discipline of cognitive science, with broad knowledge and a solid methodological training covering all of the cognitive sciences. 

each cogmaster student builds, together with his/her tutor, a personalised curriculum organised around one major and one or several optional minors. majors typically correspond to the main areas of cognitive science, and may be chosen according to each studentsâ€™ project and skills.
